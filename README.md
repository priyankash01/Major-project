# 🧠 MindSync: AI-Powered Mental Health Assistant

## 🌟 Overview
Mental health challenges are increasingly prevalent, yet access to immediate, personalized, and stigma-free support remains limited. MindSync is an intelligent conversational AI assistant designed to provide initial mental health support, identify potential risk factors, and guide users to relevant resources.
By combining Large Language Models (LLMs) and traditional Machine Learning (ML) techniques, MindSync offers a compassionate, accessible, and privacy-preserving platform for individuals seeking early intervention and emotional check-ins.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Implement NLP techniques using pre-trained LLMs (e.g., GPT, RoBERTa, BERT)
- Build a conversational AI capable of analyzing user inputs and classifying emotional states
- Integrate mental health screening tools (e.g., PHQ-9 scoring)
- Design a chatbot interface that supports natural, empathetic conversation
- Evaluate performance based on accuracy, sensitivity, and user experience



## 💡 Proposed Solution

- Detect emotional states such as stress, anxiety, or low mood using LLM-based sentiment and emotion analysis.
- Identify signs of mental distress through conversation.
- Provide a working prototype of a chatbot deployable on web/mobile platforms.
- Offer non-clinical, preliminary support while emphasizing that AI complements—not replaces—human mental health care.
